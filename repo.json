```Please go to your `invidious-repo` and edit the `repo.json` to have this corrected content. It must point to the `extensions` repository where your compiled code lives.

**2. Your `extensions` Repository (The "Factory and Warehouse")**

*   **Its Job:** This is where all the work happens. It holds your source code, the build system, and the finished, compiled plugin.
*   **The `main` (or `master`) Branch:** This is your "factory floor." It contains all your source code (`.kt` files) that you write and edit.
*   **The `builds` Branch:** This is your "warehouse." The `make` command automatically compiled your code and placed the finished products here. This branch contains:
    *   The compiled `InvidiousProvider.cs3` file.
    *   A `plugins.json` file that lists all available plugins and points to the `.cs3` file.

### The Complete Flow

Here is how it works together:

1.  CloudStream App contacts your `invidious-repo`.
2.  It reads `repo.json`.
3.  The corrected `repo.json` tells the app to go to `.../tauquir-mta/extensions/builds/plugins.json`.
4.  The app downloads `plugins.json`, which tells it where to find `InvidiousProvider.cs3`.
5.  The app downloads and installs the plugin.

### Your Final Action

1.  **Correct the `repo.json` file** in your `invidious-repo` on GitHub using the content I provided above.
2.  **You are now completely finished.** The only thing left to do is add the repository URL to your CloudStream app.

**The URL to add to CloudStream (it has not changed):**
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tauquir-mta/invidious-repo/main/repo.json`

You have successfully completed the entire process. Congratulations on your persistence
